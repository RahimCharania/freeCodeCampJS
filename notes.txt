//Data types:

7 different:

undefined
null
boolean
string
symbol
number
object

//Variables:

Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. 
They do this by  using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself. 
Any of the seven data types may be stored in a variable.

variable create or declare syntax:

var ourName;        //creates a variable called ourName


Note: Assignment always goes from right to left.


camelCase named variables are good practice.

Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings ==> use backslashes before the quotes ou don't want the sentence to end with.
